# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering** to identify key customer groups based on features like age, income, spending score, and gender. The goal is to uncover actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and data-driven business decisions.

## Project Overview

### Key Features:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied clustering on customer data to identify distinct segments based on income and spending habits.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized data to improve the performance of the clustering algorithm.
- **Cluster Optimization**: Used the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters, resulting in 5 distinct customer groups.
- **Actionable Insights**: The segmentation revealed high-potential customers with low income but high spending capacity, enabling more focused marketing efforts.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for K-Means clustering
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Results

- Identified **5 distinct customer segments** based on income and spending scores.
- Developed **targeted marketing strategies** to focus on high-potential customers with specific spending patterns.
